Welcome to my blog!

I am Carl and I work at [Aleph Alpha](https://app.aleph-alpha.com/). Before that I studied Data Science and Communication Science in Amsterdam with a brief stint in Dortmund during my Masters. I did a lot's of different internships at different organisations (from cold sales to AI research), which was a great experience. I truly value all the different perspectives I got during all those experiences as they often allow me to understand different perspectives on a problem better. If you would like to know more, head to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-philipp-s-3250b9139/).

On this blog I want to share stuff that I learn and find interesting. I hope you will find some joy reading my texts!
