# Writing a blog
I always wanted to write a blog and this is my first shot at it. I created this blog using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I love writing in Markdown as it is versatile and easy to use. As an avid reader of Vincent Warmerdam's [blog](https://koaning.io/) I saw that he was using Material for MkDocs, so I thought I might give it a shot and here we are! 

It will be interesting to see if this will be the only post I ever make or if it will be the first of many and I will write a follow-up post after some time about running and maintaining a blog.
